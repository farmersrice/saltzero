model_info stores best network.

please note that training plateaued ~64th best net in the first run, 69th net consistently lost by a small amount to the 64th net.

learning rate for 64th net was manually lowered from 0.001 to 0.0003 (using https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47523841/using-keras-to-load-model-and-assign-new-values-to-its-parameters)

all nets from 65 onward were deleted and training restarted.

74 and 78 were compared



93rd network could barely beat the 74th network. Probably needs a lowering of learning rate again.

93rd model renamed to 0th model in order to save space while putting to gdrive.

Learning rate was manually lowered once again to 0.0001.

20th model, new best, was lowered to 1e-5 learning rate. Then it was renamed to the 0th model yet again.

Then the 21st model after that was renamed to 0th again.


New network created: using 7 shared blocks of mlp resnet, 1024 neurons, learning rate 0.01 to start.
also lowered the loss weight of the value head to 0.1 to reduce overfitting, since we're using all training data.


19th network of resnet surpassed the old best network (which used 6 shared blocks of 512 neurons each).


43rd was last strongest net, some reason 44th lost 250:150.	

After training overnight, 57th network lost to the 43rd network (179:221 and another round 176:224, pretty big).

59th network is clone of 43rd network with lowered learning rate to 0.003.

63rd new model was renamed to 0th model again.

For some reason the network got weaker; 17th model was about equal to the new 0th model. Must have forgotten something along the way.

Renaming 8th model to the best and trying again, lowered learning rate to 0.001.

Increased gating threshold to 210/400.

Renamed 13th model to 0th model for release purposes.

Trained another 20 nets but none were stronger than the 0th. Lowering learning rate yet again to 0.0003.

Trained 18 more nets; result:

(Mistyped the p6 vs p7 duel by 10 games, but it doesn't really matter)

Renamed 13th model to 0th again, lowered learning rate to 0.0001.

None of next 16 models could match up. Lowered learning rate to 0.00003.

Still couldn't stack up over the next 13 models. New architecture time!

lowered 16th learning rate to 0.003 and continued

lowered 22nd learning rate to 0.001 and continued

50th model still couldn't beat 0th, lowered learning rate of 29th model to 0.0003 (it had higher winrate)
